# HOW
* Create Model (Business Analyst) -  Models contain milestones, identifier and indicators (measures and dimensions). 
An Integration Insight model provides a grammar for describing the milestones of a business process that are key for tracking business performance. You can have business friendly milestone such as filePicked, fileUploaded etc. These milestones can of various type – start, terminal, error, standard, terminal/error.
* Define a unique identifier -  Every Integration Insight model must have a unique instance identifier defined. It describes a value that is extracted at runtime for every instance of the business process defined by the model.
* Define Indicators –  
** Measures identify values, which allow the state of the application to be quantified.
** Dimensions provide a type of grouping and categorization of applications, allowing for “slicing and dicing” of aggregate measures.
* Map Milestones to Implementation (integration architect). map the previously created milestones to the respective Integration flow.
* Define Extraction Criteria (Integration Architect) -  This defines how to extract data from the integration variables available at the point when the respective milestone has been mapped. 
* Activate the Model - With all milestones mapped and indicators defined, the model can now be activated.
* View and Analyze data – 
** You can use OOTB dashboard or
** Create Custom Dashboards.
